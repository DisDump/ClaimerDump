# Running a Script with Node.js

Assuming you have a script named `index.js`, you can run it using Node.js by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your `index.js` file is located using the `cd` command.
3. Run the script with the following command:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    Replace `index.js` with the actual name of your script if it's different.

That's it! You have now installed Node.js and run a script using Node.js.
